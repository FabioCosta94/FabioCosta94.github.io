                        <p>I've been working as a secretary at the polling station in each referendum or election there has been since I got 18 years old. Once I turned 13, I started tutoring students in any scientific subject. During my university career,
                            I turned this job official by working for the S.I.A. association, which made me tutor foreign students or people with mental disabilities. Between 2013 and 2016, I also worked at the Chili Pepper pizza shop as a pizza delivery
                            boy.

                            Between 2013 and 2016 I worked for Gedis S.p.a. as a Tournament Organizer and Judge of Trading Card Games and videogames events of the Pok√©mon saga. Occasionally, I work for European Union Youth associations such as Assonur for small jobs such as English/Italian
                            translations or project design.

                        <p>I had the chance to travel a lot, and many of my travels turned out to be an adventure that shaped my soul in some way. One time, for example, I risked getting stuck in Albania because there had been problems with the ship I had
                            to get in to get back home, and nobody could speak English to notify me of such problem. Another time I got stuck in Lion on my way to Manchester for a couple of days because of some airport bureaucracy.

                            Of course, I could not talk about my travel experiences without mentioning my Erasmus+ experiences I had thanks to the Assonur association. I had the chance to work with people from all around Europe (and bonded with many of them). Thanks to such, I had
                            the chance to know some of the cultures coming from Romania, Hungary, Albania, Estonia, Serbia, and a part of Switzerland. Outside of the Erasmus experiences I also traveled to Britain, France, and Spain for entertainment purposes.
                            I wish to travel and have many new experiences, trying to understand and live the life of the communities all around the world and make them part of me.

                        <p class="mb-0">In July 2020 I finished my first IT programming course "Junior Full Stack Developer" by The Net Value. The course gave me a new perspective and made me decide to grow as a developer, and maybe specialize in some programming fields,
                            once I get more accustomed to some of them. Each year I participate in the Cagliari Global Game Jam, working for 48 hours straight to complete a project with a team created on the spot. I would recommend such experience to
                            anyone, even to someone not interested in programming. I am open and eager to live new experiences, hoping the future will give me the chance to find more.
