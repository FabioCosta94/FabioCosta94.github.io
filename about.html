                            </h2>
                            <p>I was born in 1994 and lived in Quartu Sant'Elena (Sardinia) all my life. I graduated in Chemistry in 2019. People usually describe me as a kind and humorous person. I can say I use whatever methods I can to get to people's
                                trust, and make sure to make such unwaver in order to maintain all the bonds I manage to develop.</p>
                            <p>I consider myself to be <em>brutally</em> honest and transparent with anyone, even if it can get things unconfortable. I consider transparency to be among the most (if not the top) important skill to develop in order to achieve
                                the best environment between two or more people.
                            </p>
                            <p>I love to push myself out of my comfort zone, because I consider such to be the most efficient way to grow and develop new skills. I lived many experiences which changed my life (for the better and worse), but I always welcome
                                changes. Even more, I constantly force myself into situations which can trigger changes in my life so I can develop my adaptability and improvisation skill.
                            </p>
                            <p>I have (and had) many passions and dreams. I am a lot into video (and board) game design, and soon I will start studying some videogame development as well. I read many fantasy books, and I took some piano lessons for some
                                time. I've been playing (and mastering) Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder campaigns for years, and sooner or later I will try some new role-playing systems as well. I recently started watching and analyzing movies as well
                                as I do with games.
                                <p class="mb-0">The goals I'm aiming for at the moment revolve mostly around programming. I would like to develop my programming skills and becoming a senior developer. In doing so, I want to achieve economy independence as well, so I
                                    can be able to live by my own. I would like to start taking drums and graffiti lessons to feel more fulfilled artistically. Finally, I want to travel as much as I can, and maybe to try to live in many different places,
                                    so I can enrich my culture as much as I can.</p>
